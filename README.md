# LOCAL_CRON
------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nardinan/local_cron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nardinan/local_cron)

A very simple and portable version of CRON that I wrote in a couple of hour to use in a remote server without root permissions. This software needs Miranda (http://github.com/nardinan/miranda on the branch 'release_0.1') and has been tested on Scientific Linux (>= 6.5).
